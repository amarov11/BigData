The C2 Non-Application Layer Protocol technique involves using transport layer protocols like TCP or UDP for command-and-control communication, bypassing application-layer defenses. Tools like powercat in PowerShell can facilitate covert C2 channels by leveraging these lower-level protocols.

Domain Policy modification (T1070.004) involves altering Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in Active Directory to bypass security measures, maintain access, or escalate privileges. It can include disabling auditing or modifying user rights. Detection requires monitoring GPO changes and auditing logs.

DLL Injection - MavInject - Process Event:
DLL Injection is a technique where a malicious DLL is injected into another process's memory to control or manipulate its behavior. MavInject is a tool used for this, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code within a target process.

DLL injection is a technique where attackers force a running process to load a malicious DLL into its memory. This allows the attacker to execute code within the targeted process, often for gaining persistence, evading detection, or performing malicious activities without triggering alarms. It can be combined with other techniques like process hollowing or reflective DLL injection.

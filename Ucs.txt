Attackers use the Startup Folder for persistence by placing files that execute automatically at each user logon. This ensures malicious programs run every time the system starts, maintaining access.

Adversaries use hidden files and directories to evade detection, marking files with hidden attributes or creating concealed folders. This tactic keeps malicious components undetected, aiding persistence on the system

C2 Non-Application Layer Protocol refers to using tools like Netcat to create covert communication channels. Detection focuses on monitoring process creation and command-line arguments for unusual network activity

The C2 Non-Application Layer Protocol technique involves using transport layer protocols like TCP or UDP for command-and-control communication, bypassing application-layer defenses. Tools like powercat in PowerShell can facilitate covert C2 channels by leveraging these lower-level protocols.

C2 Non-Application Layer Protocol - PowerShellIcmp - Powershell Events

owerShellIcmp uses PowerShell to craft and send ICMP packets for covert Command and Control communication, bypassing traditional detection. This technique exploits the ICMP protocol, which is often allowed by network defenses, to evade monitoring systems.



Domain Policy modification (T1070.004) involves altering Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in Active Directory to bypass security measures, maintain access, or escalate privileges. It can include disabling auditing or modifying user rights. Detection requires monitoring GPO changes and auditing logs.

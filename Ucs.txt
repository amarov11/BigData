Pass-the-Ticket (Golden Ticket) is a credential theft and lateral movement technique in which attackers use Kerberos ticket-granting tickets (TGTs) forged with domain administrator credentials. This allows them to authenticate as any user within a domain without needing the user’s password. The Golden Ticket exploit provides long-term access to the compromised domain, often bypassing traditional password policies.
